# Introduction to GoogolSharp

GoogolSharp is a C# library designed for working with **extremely large and small numbers**, inspired by the field of *googology* and advanced numeric representations.  

At its core, GoogolSharp introduces a custom numeric type called **`Arithmonym`**, which encodes values far beyond conventional floating‑point ranges. This makes it possible to represent numbers that are:

- Larger than `double.MaxValue`
- Smaller than `double.MinValue`
- Symbolically extended into googological scales (e.g., numbers represented with “letters”)

Unlike traditional floating‑point types, `Arithmonym` uses a **compact 96‑bit word layout** to efficiently store sign, reciprocal flags, symbolic scales, and fractional precision.  

GoogolSharp is built for researchers, hobbyists, and developers who want to explore **numeric frontiers** without being constrained by standard floating‑point limitations.
