# DevLog of GoogolSharp
## Day 1 (12/12/25)
Had to debug too much stuff... Not much to say.
## Day 2 (13/12/25)
Thought debugging was over, so went on to make a test suite, and found a bunch of problems
## Day 3 (14/12/25)
Lots of debugging got to a final result of almost working code
## Day 4 (15/12/25)
Finally, all 34 tests succeeded! Went on to refactor a bit and work on these things:
## Day 5
In the first half of Day 5, made lots of commits and finally fixed the problems that arose.

Now, the focus is on documentation, and implementing MORE interfaces. Maybe tackle `INumberBase` or `INumber` soon?

## Day 6

Yay! Implemented both `INumberBase` and `INumber`, but some functionality is TODO. Also, maybe the docs MD... Maybe work on `ToString` and `Parse`?
